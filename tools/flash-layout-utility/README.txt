This is a hackish tool to help lay out game screens by taking advantage of the
Flash IDE.

Load up the layout/layout.xfl file in your flash IDE to take a look at it.

Before you run it, you should make a copy of the whole flash-layout-utility
folder and put it somewhere. That copy becomes the layout for a single screen.
You need to make a copy for each screen you need.

Caveats
=======

- You can't scale things. Well you can, just don't expect it to look right.
